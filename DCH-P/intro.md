It's called the DCH-P (Digital Cinema Hub Player) and introduces a whole set of updates:   

- Stability updates
- Settings GUI directly on the machine: set up network (DHCP/fixed IP settings etc.), adjust sound output/volume, set resolution
- Troubleshooting GUI directly on the machine: logs, troubleshooting suggestions, background services status
- No command-line work needed: all common settings can now be done directly in the UI
- Shows and blocks: The DCH-P supports automated scheduling and playout of shows consisting of the following blocks: CineGame, CineCard, CineAd, CineClash, CineStream (more info here: [https://www.cinemataztic.com/products](https://www.cinemataztic.com/products))  
    

We're working on making it possible to manage these settings directly from cloud too in a cascading manner, so it can be set at several levels and inherited, e.g. volume can be set on country level, and inherited the following way: country > cinema > sreeen
